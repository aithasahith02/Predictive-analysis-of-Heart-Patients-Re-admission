# Heart Failure Patient Readmission Analysis

This project, which I am currently working on, involves analyzing patient data from the MIMIC-III database to predict ICU readmissions for heart failure patients within five days of discharge. The analysis aims to provide healthcare professionals with actionable insights to optimize patient care and hospital resource management.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on extracting and processing heart failure patient data using SQL queries to identify patterns in ICU readmissions. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted on the MIMIC-III database, including patient admissions, diagnoses, ICU stays, and medications, with the goal of providing insights into patient readmission risks.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: Data extraction, processing, and transformation.
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development and analysis environment.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is from the [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org/) clinical database, which contains de-identified healthcare data of patients admitted to critical care units at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

## Key Features

- **Heart Failure Data Extraction**: Filter heart failure patients from MIMIC-III using ICD-9 codes.
- **ICU Readmission Prediction**: Focused on predicting ICU readmissions within five days of discharge.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Uncover key factors influencing patient outcomes and ICU readmissions.
